# Hyperapp2000

Hyperapp boilerplate with Webpack, Typescript and Sass. Prettified by Prettier. Basically a clone of [HyperApp One](https://github.com/selfup/hyperapp-one) with different settings.

## Setup

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/judas-christ/hyperapp2000.git
```

Wipe the old and create a new repo:

```bash
npm run wipe
```

Install packages and run the app:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Build something.
